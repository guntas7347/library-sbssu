        This University Library Portal was developed as part of an initiative to
        enhance access to library resources for students and faculty.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Guntas Singh, a B.Tech CSE (2023) student of this university. I
        undertook this project to apply my technical skills to a practical,
        impactful system.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. JAPINDER SINGH for
        his mentorship and key technical guidance throughout the development
        process. His support was instrumental in shaping this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also thank Sukhdev Sir for his additional technical assistance in
        server deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Special thanks to Librarian Mr. Tej Pal Verma for his cooperation and
        insights into the library system, which helped align the portal with the
        actual needs of library users.
